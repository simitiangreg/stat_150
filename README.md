# stat_150

Stat 150 taught by Benson Au, Fall 2023. This is the second upper-division course in probability at Berkeley, typically preceded by Stat 134, Data 140 or EECS 126. The class is largely focused on stochastic processes. We used both Pinksy-Karlin and Durrett.

Stat 150 at UC Berkeley is a great course. I am still learning how to use Latex, but this class provided some good practice.
